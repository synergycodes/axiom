# Axiom UI

Axiom is an open-source React library built specifically for developers creating node-based UIs and diagram-driven applications. Unlike traditional UI or diagramming libraries, Axiom brings both worlds together — offering a cohesive design system that includes both interface components and diagram elements out of the box.

## Overview

Forget cobbling together UI kits with diagram libraries. Axiom provides a unified set of designed, ready-to-use components: buttons, inputs, accordions, node templates, and more — all built to work seamlessly together.

## Features

- **Unified Component System**: Seamlessly integrated UI and diagram components
- **Ready-to-use Components**: Comprehensive set of pre-built components
- **Token-based Customization**: Easy theming through CSS variables
- **Developer-friendly**: Focus on developer experience and productivity
- **React Flow Compatible**: Perfect for React Flow users with pre-built node templates that match React Flow's styling

## React Flow Integration

Axiom is designed to work seamlessly with React Flow, providing:
- Node templates that match React Flow's styling and behavior
- Components that integrate perfectly with React Flow's node system
- CSS classes that align with React Flow's design patterns
- No direct dependency on React Flow, allowing you to use it with any version

## Customization

Customization is effortless thanks to Axiom's token-based system using CSS variables. You can easily tweak colors, border radius, spacing, and other design primitives to match your brand or project style—without digging deep into complex theming systems.

## Why Axiom?

Axiom isn't just another UI kit. It's a thoughtfully designed, developer-friendly toolkit that helps you move faster, stay consistent, and focus on building powerful diagram-based experiences — without reinventing the wheel.
